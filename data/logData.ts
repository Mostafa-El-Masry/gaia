      "Today I created the foundation for GAIA in Next.js. I used npx create-next-app@latest to scaffold the project. I chose TypeScript, ESLint, and TailwindCSS as the core tools. After some initial errors, I got the app running successfully and deployed a demo version to Vercel. GAIA officially has a heartbeat.",

    title: "⚡ Day 2 – Logging the Journey",
    content:
      "I focused on creating a Log system for GAIA. I set up a logdata.tsx file to hold entries like this one, which will document every step of the journey. I also discussed whether to keep log data inside the same app or in a separate database. For now, I chose to keep it separate for clarity.",

    title: "📂 Day 3 – The Loader Idea",
    content:
      "I asked about building a Loader system like the one I had in vanilla JavaScript, where components load dynamically into the main page. We discovered that in Next.js this can be done differently, using layouts and components instead of manual loaders. I left styling (hamburger menu and mobile-friendly UI) for later steps.",

    title: "🧩 Day 4 – First React Hurdles",
    content:
      "I experimented with loading components (like the Log) in Next.js. At first I struggled with React concepts (useState, useEffect) and got errors. Instead of forcing it, I decided to keep it simple and continue with the Log as it is now. The goal became: get something working, refine later. I also confirmed that I want to document each day as a narrative in the Log.",

    title: "🌐 Day 5 – Navbar Added",
    content:
      "Today I built the Navbar for GAIA. I created a Navbar.tsx component, added navigation links for Home, Log, Money, Photos, and Videos. Then I included it in the layout.tsx file so it appears on all pages. The Navbar is styled with TailwindCSS (dark background, white text) and uses Next.js <Link> for smooth, instant navigation. GAIA now feels more like a real application.",
