Date: Sept 19, 2025
Stage: Step 1 – Migration to Next.js

✔️ Completed so far
	•	Installed latest Next.js with TypeScript + TailwindCSS.
	•	Confirmed project runs locally with npm run dev.
	•	Uploaded project to GitHub (remote repo linked).
	•	Deployed demo site successfully to Vercel.
	•	Verified cross-device access (works on another machine with git pull).

⏳ Current Focus
	•	Exploring & testing basic structure.
	•	No functional components fully migrated yet.

🎯 Next Steps (short-term)
	1.	Start building page structure (pages/ or new app/ directory depending on Next.js version).
	2.	Migrate Navbar as first reusable component.
	3.	Confirm deployment updates automatically to Vercel after each commit."`
